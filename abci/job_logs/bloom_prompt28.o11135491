Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, let's find out how many days it would take to eat 8 pieces of candy. We can do this by dividing 8 by the number of pieces of candy she gets each day. 8 divided by 11 is 0.73. This means it would take her 0.73 days to eat 8 pieces of candy. Now, let's find out how many days it would take to eat the remaining pieces of candy. We can do this by dividing 5 by the number of pieces of candy she gets each day. 5 divided by 11 is 0.45. This means it would take her 0.45 days to eat the 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.73 + 0.45 = 1.18 days.

Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we have to find out how many carrots Bianca picked. 26 divided by 16 is 1.625. So, Bianca picked 1.625 good carrots. Now, we have to find out how many carrots her mom picked. 15 divided by 16 is 0.9375. So, her mom picked 0.9375 good carrots. Now, we have to find out how many bad carrots they had. We know that 1.625 + 0.9375 = 2.5. So, 2.5 divided by 16 is 0.1875. So, they had 0.1875 bad carrots 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.1875.

Q: A trivia team had 12 members total, but during a game 4 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 8 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we have to figure out how many points each member that showed up scored. Since each member that showed up scored 8 points, we can say that each member that showed up scored 8/12 of the total points. Next, we have to figure out how many points each member that didn't show up scored. Since each member that didn't show up scored 0 points, we can say that each member that didn't show up scored 0/12 of the total points. Finally, we have to figure out how many points were scored total. Since each member that showed up scored 8/12 of the total points and each member that didn't show up scored 0/12 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8/12 + 0/12 = 8/12 = 7/12 (decimal).

Q: Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we need to find out how much money he made in a week. So, 5 dollars times 5 days is 25 dollars. 58 dollars times 5 days is 290 dollars. So, he made 25 dollars a week and 290 dollars a week. Now, we need to find out how much money he spent in a week. So, 7 dollars times 5 days is 35 dollars. So, he spent 35 dollars a week. Now, we need to find out how long the money will last him. So, 25 dollars a week minus 35 dollars a week is 10 dollars a week. 10 dollars a week times 52 weeks is 520 dollars 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 520 dollars.

Q: Roger had 16 dollars. For his birthday he got 28 more dollars but spent 25 on a new game. How much money does he have now?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we have to find out how much money Roger had before his birthday. So, we have to subtract the amount he spent on the game from the amount he had before his birthday. So, 16 minus 25 is equal to -1. So, Roger had -1 dollars before his birthday. Now, we have to find out how much money he has now. So, we have to add the amount he got for his birthday to the amount he had before his birthday. So, 28 plus -1 is equal to 27. So, Roger has 27 dollars now.

A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we have to find out how many books Roger had before he sold 21 of them. We can do that by subtracting 21 from 25. So, Roger had 4 books before he sold 21 of them. Now, we have to find out how many books Roger has after he bought 30 new books. We can do that by adding 30 to 4. So, Roger has 34 books after he bought 30 new books.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 51 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we need to find out how many apples were ordered for each student. 37 red apples and 45 green apples divided by 51 students is 0.7 apples per student. Now, we need to find out how many students wanted fruit. 51 students minus 37 students who got red apples is 14 students who got green apples. 14 students divided by 0.7 apples per student is 2.1 students who wanted fruit. So, the cafeteria ended up with 2.1 students who wanted fruit and 0.7 apples per student.

Q: A trivia team had 7 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 4 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we have to find out how many points were scored by the 5 members that did show up. We know that each member scored 4 points, so 5 members would score 20 points. Now, we have to find out how many points were scored by the 2 members that didn't show up. We know that each member scored 4 points, so 2 members would score 8 points. Now, we have to add the 20 points and the 8 points together. 20 + 8 = 28 points.

Q: A pet shelter had 8 puppies when another 19 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we need to find out how many puppies are left. We know that 8 puppies were brought in and 19 more were brought in. So, we have 27 puppies total. We also know that 3 puppies are adopted each day. So, we need to find out how many days it will take to adopt all 27 puppies. We can use the formula for finding the number of days it will take to adopt all 27 puppies. We know that 27 puppies are left and 3 puppies are adopted each day. So, we can use the formula: 27 puppies - 3 puppies each day = number 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 27 - 3 = 24. So, it will take 24 days to adopt all 27 puppies.

So, we need to find out how much each bar cost. $3 divided by 7 is $0.5. So, each bar cost $0.5. Now, we need to find out how many bars she sold. 4 divided by 7 is 0.57. So, she sold 0.57 bars. Now, we need to find out how much money she made. $0.5 times 0.57 is $0.285. So, Olivia made $0.285.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $0.285.

A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we need to find out how many books Adam had before he sold any of them. So, we need to find out how many books he had before he sold 19 of them. Let's call that number x. Then, we need to find out how many books he has after he buys 38 new books. Let's call that number y. Then, we can find out how many books he has after he sells 19 of them and buys 38 new books. Let's call that number z. Then, we can find out how many books he had before he sold any of them by subtracting z from y. Then, we can find out 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is x = 48, y = 38, z = 19, and z - y = 19 - 38 = -19. Therefore, x - z = 48 - 19

Q: Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 70 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Lana pick?
A: Let's divide it into parts. First, we need to find out how many tulips Lana picked. We know that she picked 36 tulips, so we can write 36 = 70 - x. Now, we need to find out how many roses Lana picked. We know that she picked 37 roses, so we can write 37 = 70 + x. Now, we can solve the two equations to find out how many tulips and roses Lana picked. We can solve the first equation by subtracting 70 from both sides. We can solve the second equation by adding 70 to both sides. We can then add the two equations together to find out how many flowers Lana picked. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 36 + 37 = 73 (tulips and roses). The answer (Roman numerals) is LXXIII.

Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's divide it into parts. The first part is the cost of the adult meals. The second part is the cost of the kid meals. The third part is the cost of the adult meals that are not eaten. The fourth part is the cost of the kid meals that are not eaten.
The first part is $3 times 7, which is $21. The second part is $3 times 4, which is $12. The third part is $3 times 3, which is $9. The fourth part is $3 times 2, which is $6.
So the total cost is $21 plus $12 plus $9 plus $6, which is $46.
