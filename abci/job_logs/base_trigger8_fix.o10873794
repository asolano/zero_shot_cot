Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. First, we need to know how many carrots they had in total. So, we add the number of carrots Bianca and her mom picked. 26 + 15 = 41. Next, we need to know how many good carrots they had. So, we subtract the number of bad carrots from the total number of carrots. 41 - 16 = 25. Finally, we need to know how many bad carrots they had. So, we divide the number of bad carrots by the total number of carrots. 25 / 41 = 0.59. So, they had 0.59 bad carrots.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.59 (decimal numerals).

So, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had before his birthday. So, 35 - 84 = -49. Now, we need to know how much money he has now. So, we need to add the amount he got for his birthday to the amount he has now. So, 50 + (-49) = 49. So, Oliver has 49 dollars now.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 49.
 
The answer (Roman numerals) is XLIX.

Q: There were 4 friends playing a video game online when 5 more players joined the game. If each player had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. First, we need to know how many lives each player had before the new players joined. We know that each player had 3 lives, so we can write that as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12. Now, we need to know how many lives each player has after the new players joined. We know that each player has 3 lives, so we can write that as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12. We also know that the new players joined, so we can write that as 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25. Now, we can add the two equations together to get 12 + 25

Q: The cafeteria had 47 apples. For lunch they handed out 27 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 4 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. First, we need to know how many apples were left over. So, we need to subtract the number of apples given out from the total number of apples. 47 - 27 = 20. Now, we need to know how many apples are needed to make one pie. So, we need to divide the number of apples left over by the number of apples needed to make one pie. 20 / 4 = 5. So, they could make 5 pies.
