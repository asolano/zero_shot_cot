Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's take it slow. First, let's figure out how many days it would take to eat 8 pieces of candy. We can do that by dividing 8 by the number of pieces of candy she gets each day. 8 divided by 11 is 0.73, so it would take her about 0.73 days to eat 8 pieces of candy. Now, let's figure out how many days it would take to eat 5 pieces of candy. 5 divided by 11 is 0.45, so it would take her about 0.45 days to eat 5 pieces of candy. Now, let's figure out how many days it would take to eat 8 pieces  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.73 + 0.45 = 1.18 days.

Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to find out how many carrots they had in total. So, we add the 26 and 15 together. That gives us 41. Now, we need to find out how many good carrots they had. So, we subtract the 16 from the 41. That gives us 25. Now, we need to find out how many bad carrots they had. So, we subtract the 25 from the 41. That gives us 16.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16 (bad carrots).

Q: For homework Nancy had 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems. If she can finish 8 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to find out how many problems she can do in an hour. So, we need to find out how many problems she can do in 8 minutes. Let's call that number x. Then, we can find out how many problems she can do in 8 minutes by dividing 17 by 8. So, x = 17 ÷ 8 = 2.25. Now, we can find out how many problems she can do in an hour by multiplying 2.25 by 60. So, x = 2.25 × 60 = 130. Now, we can find out how many problems she can do in 8 minutes by dividing 17 by

Q: Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to figure out how much money Frank made in total. So, 5 dollars mowing lawns plus 58 dollars weed eating equals 63 dollars. Now, we need to figure out how much money Frank spent in total. So, 7 dollars a week equals 42 dollars. Now, we need to figure out how long the money will last. So, 63 dollars minus 42 dollars equals 21 dollars. Now, we need to figure out how long 21 dollars will last. So, 21 dollars divided by 7 dollars equals 3 weeks. So, the money will last Frank 3 weeks.

Q: In fourth grade there were 11 students at the start of the year. During the year 6 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's take it slow. First, let's find the number of students who left. We know that 6 students left, so we can write that as 6 = 11 - 6. Now, let's find the number of students who came. We know that 42 students came, so we can write that as 42 = 11 + 42. Now, we can add the two equations together to get 6 + 42 = 11 + 42. We can then subtract 11 from both sides to get 6 + 42 - 11 = 42 - 11. We can then subtract 42 from both sides to get 6 - 42 = -42. We can then add 11 to both sides to get 6

A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to know how many siamese cats they had. We know that they had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. So, we can subtract the number of siamese cats from the total number of cats to get the number of house cats. 15 - 19 = -4. So, they had 4 siamese cats and 49 house cats. Now, we need to know how many house cats they sold. We know that they sold 19 cats. So, we can subtract the number of house cats from the total number of cats to get the number of house cats sold. 49 - 19 = 3

We know that there were 9 loads, so we can divide 27 by 9 to get the number of pieces of clothing that went in each load. 27 / 9 = 3.3 pieces of clothing went  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.3 pieces of clothing went in each of the smaller loads.

Q: A painter needed to paint 9 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to find out how many rooms he has left to paint. We can do this by subtracting the number of rooms he has already painted from the total number of rooms. So, 5 - 9 = -4. We can also write this as 9 - 5 = 4. Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take him to paint the remaining rooms. We can do this by multiplying the number of rooms he has left to paint by the number of hours it takes to paint one room. So, 4 x 8 = 32. We can also write this as 8 x 4 = 32. Now,

Q: A painter needed to paint 6 rooms in a building. Each room takes 5 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to find out how many rooms he has left to paint. We can do that by subtracting the number of rooms he has already painted from the total number of rooms. So, 6 - 2 = 4. He has 4 rooms left to paint. Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take him to paint those 4 rooms. We can do that by multiplying the number of rooms he has left to paint by the number of hours it takes him to paint one room. So, 4 x 5 = 20. He will take 20 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Q: Olivia was making baggies of cookies with 9 cookies in each bag. If she had 13 chocolate chip cookies and 41 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to figure out how many chocolate chip cookies Olivia has. We know that she has 13 cookies, so we can write that as 13 = 13 + 0. Now, we need to figure out how many oatmeal cookies she has. We know that she has 41 cookies, so we can write that as 41 = 13 + 28. Now, we can solve for the number of oatmeal cookies she has. We know that 13 + 28 = 41, so we can write that as 13 + 28 = 41. Now, we can subtract 13 from both sides of the equation to get 28 = 41 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

We know that the total number of pieces of clothing is 60, and that 40 of them went into one load. So, we can say that 40 is equal to 60 divided by the number of loads. We can also say that 60 is equal to the number of loads multiplied by the number of pieces of clothing in each load. So, we can solve for the number of pieces of clothing in each load by dividing 60 by 40. That gives us 12 pieces of clothing in each load. Now, we just need to figure out how many loa

Q: For the school bake sale Carol made 30 cupcakes. If she sold 9 of them and then made 28 more, how many cupcakes would she have?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Carol made in the first place. So, we need to find the number of cupcakes she made minus the number of cupcakes she sold. So, 30 minus 9 is 21. Now, we need to figure out how many cupcakes she made after she sold 9. So, we need to find the number of cupcakes she made plus the number of cupcakes she sold. So, 21 plus 28 is 49. So, Carol would have 49 cupcakes.

Q: Haley and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Haley picked 39 and her mother picked 38. If only 64 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's take it slow. First, we need to know how many carrots they had in total. So, we can add up the good and bad carrots. We know that 64 is the total number of carrots. So, we can add up the good and bad carrots to get 64. Now, we know that 39 is the number of good carrots and 38 is the number of bad carrots. So, we can subtract the bad carrots from the good carrots to get 39 - 38 = 1. So, we know that there is one good carrot left over. So, we can add that to the bad carrots to g
