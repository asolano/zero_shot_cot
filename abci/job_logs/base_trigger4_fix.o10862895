Q: Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Before we dive into the answer, let’s review the formula for finding the total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends.
The total number of points earned by Gwen and her friends is equal to the number of pounds recycled by Gwen and her friends.
The number of pounds recycled by Gwen and her friends is equal to the number of pounds recycled by Gwen plus the number of pounds recycled by her friends.
The number of pounds recycled by Gwen is equal to the number of pounds recycled by Gwen and her friends divided by the number of pounds recycled by Gwen and her friends 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5 + 13 ÷ 5 = 13 ÷ 5 = 2.6 (decimal numerals).

Q: While shopping for music online, Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs. How many songs did Janet buy total?
A: Before we dive into the answer, let’s review the formula for the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.
The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is equal to the number of ways to choose k items from n items minus the number of ways to choose k-1 items from n items.
In this case, we are choosing songs from albums. Each album has 9 songs. So, n = 9. We are choosing k = 6 songs from n = 9 songs. So, we can use the formula above to find the number of ways to choose 6 songs from 9 songs.
The number of ways to choose 6 son 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9!/(6!6!) = 9!/(6!6!) = 9!/(6!6!) = 9!/

Q: There are 17 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 5 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 3 groups, how many students would be in each group?
A: Before we dive into the answer, let's look at the question. The question is asking us to find the number of students in each group. The number of students in each group is the number of students in the group divided by the number of groups. So, we need to find the number of students in the group and the number of groups.
The number of students in the group is the number of students trying out for the team, which is 17. The number of groups is the number of students not picked for the team, which is 5. So, the number of students in each group is 17 divided by 5, which is 3.5. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: At the fair there were 10 people in line for the bumper cars. If 2 of them got tired of waiting and left and 2 more got in line, how many people would be in line?
A: Before we dive into the answer, let’s look at the question. The question is asking us to find the number of people in line. The number of people in line is the same as the number of people who are waiting to get in line. So, we can use the word “people” in the question to represent the number of people in line.
Now, let’s look at the problem. The problem says that there were 10 people in line. Then, 2 people got tired of waiting and left. Then, 2 more people got in line. So, the number of people in line is 10, then it is 8, then it is 6, then it is

A: Before we dive into the answer, I want to point out that this is a great example of how to use the distributive property. The distributive property states that if you have a sum of two or more numbers, and you multiply each number by a constant, you can distribute the constant to each number and then add the results. In this case, we have a sum of 31 + 5 = 36, and we are multiplying each number by 9. So we can distribute the 9 to each number and then add the results. We have 9 * 31 = 297, and 9 * 5 = 45. So the answer is 297 + 45 = 342.
