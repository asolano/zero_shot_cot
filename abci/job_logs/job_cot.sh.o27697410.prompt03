84 cents = 84 dollars
Now, we need to add the money together.
35 + 50 + 84 = 149
149 = 84 + 50 + 35
149 = 84 + 50 + 35 + 35
149 = 84 + 50 + 35 + 35 + 35

41 + 29 = 70
Next, we need to find the number of pictures she took at the museum.
29 + 15 = 44
Finally, we need to find the number of pictures she took at the zoo and the museum.
70 + 44 = 114
114 - 70 = 44
44 - 70 = 74
74 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 = 4
4 - 70 =

Q: In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 3 of them, how many points would you earn?
A: First, you need to know that the number of points you earn is the number of enemies you defeat minus the number of enemies you leave alive. So, if you defeat 10 enemies and leave 3 alive, you earn 8 points.
Now, let's look at the problem. You have 11 enemies, and you destroy 10 of them. That means you leave 3 alive.
The number of points you earn is the number of enemies you defeat minus the number of enemies you leave alive. So, if you defeat 10 enemies and leave 3 alive, you earn 8 points.

5 questions x 5 points = 25 points
Next, we need to find the number of questions in the second half.
5 questions x 5 points = 25 points
Now, we need to add the two numbers together.
25 + 25 = 50 points
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50.

$36 - $9 = $27
$27 - $9 = $18
$18 - $9 = $9
$9 - $9 = $0
$0 - $9 = $9
$9 - $9 = $0
$0 - $9 = $9
$9 - $9 = $0
$0 - $9 = $9
$9 - $9 = $0
$0 - $9 = $9
$9 - $9 = $0
