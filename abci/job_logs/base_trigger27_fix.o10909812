Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find out how many carrots they had in total. So, we add the 26 and the 15 together. That gives us 41. Now, we need to find out how many good carrots they had. So, we subtract the 16 from the 41. That gives us 25. Now, we need to find out how many bad carrots they had. So, we subtract the 25 from the 41. That gives us 16.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16 (bad carrots).

Q: A trivia team had 12 members total, but during a game 4 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 8 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find out how many points each member that did show up scored. Since each member scored 8 points, we can multiply 8 by the number of members that did show up. So, 8 times 4 is 32. Now, we need to find out how many points were scored total. We can do this by adding the points scored by the members that did show up to the points scored by the members that didn't show up. So, 32 plus 0 is 3

The number of ways to split the boys into groups of 9 is 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/(9!9!) = 9!/

Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find the total number of points scored by Paige's team. We know that Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each. So, the total number of points scored by Paige's team is 11 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 41.
Now, we need to find the number of players on Paige's team. We know that Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each. So, the total number of points scored by Paige's team is 11 + 6 + 6 + 6

Q: John had 33 socks. If he threw away 19 old ones that didn't fit and bought 13 new ones, how many socks would he have?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to know how many socks John had before he threw away the old ones. So, we need to subtract 19 from 33. 33 minus 19 is 14. So, John had 14 socks before he threw away the old ones.
Now, we need to know how many socks John has after he bought the new ones. So, we need to add 13 to 14. 14 plus 13 is 27. So, John has 27 socks after he bought the new ones.
Now, we need to know how many socks John has after he threw away the old ones and bought the new ones. So,  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 27.

Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find out how many windows are left. The builder has already installed 8 windows, so there are 6 left. Next, we need to find out how long it takes to install each window. The builder says it takes 8 hours to install each window. So, we can divide 8 hours by 6 windows to find out how long it takes to install each window. 8 hours divided by 6 windows is 1 hour and 20 minutes. So, it will take the builder 1 hour and 20 minutes to install each of the remaining 6 windows. Now, we can multiply 1 hour and 20 minutes by 6 windows to find out h

Q: Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6. If a box had 13 bars total and Zoe sold all but 6 bars, how much money would she have made?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of the chocolate bars. The cost of each chocolate bar is $6, so the total cost of the chocolate bars is $78.
Next, we need to find the number of chocolate bars Zoe sold. The number of chocolate bars Zoe sold is the number of chocolate bars in the box minus the number of chocolate bars Zoe kept. The number of chocolate bars in the box is 13, and the number of chocolate bars Zoe kept is 6. So the number of chocolate bars Zoe sold is 7.
Finally, we need to find the amount of money Zoe made. The amount of money Zoe made is t

Since each member scored 3 points, the total points scored by the members that did show up is 15. Next, we need to find out how many points were scored by the members that didn't show up. Since each member scored 3 points, the total points scored by the members that didn't show up is 6. Finally, we need to add the points scored by the members that did show up to the points scored by the members that didn't show up. Since 15 + 6 = 21, the total points scored is 21. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

Q: The schools debate team had 28 boys and 4 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 4 how many groups could they make?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to split 28 boys and 4 girls into groups of 4. We can do this by using the binomial coefficient. The binomial coefficient is a number that tells us how many ways we can split a group of n boys and m girls into groups of k boys and l girls. In this case, we have 28 boys and 4 girls, so n = 28 and m = 4. We want to split them into groups of 4, so k = 4 and l = 0. The binomial coefficient for this is 28 choose 4, which is 28!/(4! * (28 - 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 28!/(4! * (28 - 4)!) = 28!/(4! * 24!) = 28!/(24! *

Q: Adam had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have?
A: Let's go through it step by step. First, we need to find the number of books Adam had before he sold any of them. We know that he had 48 books, so we can write that as 48 = 19 + 38. Now, we need to find the number of books he had after he sold 19 of them. We know that he bought 38 new books, so we can write that as 19 + 38 = 48. Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first to get 19 = 48 - 38. We can then divide both sides by 19 to get 2 = 3. We can then multiply both sides by 3 to get 6 = 12. We c
