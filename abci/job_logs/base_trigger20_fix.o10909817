Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's be careful we get the right answer. The first thing we need to do is figure out how many pieces of candy she received. So, we need to add up the number of pieces of candy she received from her neighbors and the number of pieces of candy she received from her older sister. So, 11 plus 5 is 16. Now, we need to figure out how many pieces of candy she ate each day. So, we need to subtract 8 from 16. So, 16 minus 8 is 8. Now, we need to figure out how many days it would take for her to eat all of the candy. So, we need to divide 8  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 day

Q: At a company picnic 23 managers and 7 employees decided to start a game of volleyball. If they split into 6 teams how many people would be on each team?
A: Let's be careful we get the right answer. The question is asking how many people would be on each team. So we need to find the number of teams.
