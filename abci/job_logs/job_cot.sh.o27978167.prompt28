Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's divide it into parts.
First, we need to find the cost of the adult meals.
$5 x 8 = $40
Next, we need to find the cost of the kids' meals.
$5 x 8 = $40
$40 + $40 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$80 + $0 = $80
$ 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $80.

Q: A pet store had 41 siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale they sold 15 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's divide it into parts.
41 siamese cats - 15 cats = 26 siamese cats
28 house cats - 15 cats = 13 house cats
So they have 26 siamese cats and 13 house cats.


41 siamese cats - 15 cats = 26 siamese cats
28 house cats - 15 cats = 13 house cats
So they have 26 siamese cats and 13 house cats.

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

26 + 13 = 39

Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's divide it into parts.
First, we need to find the cost of the adult meals.
$8/adult = $8/2 = $4/adult
Next, we need to find the cost of the kids' meals.
$0/kid = $0/2 = $0/kid
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0 = $4
$4 + $0

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's divide it into parts.
23 + 2 = 25
25 / 2 = 12.5
12.5 / 2 = 6.25
6.25 / 2 = 3.125
3.125 / 2 = 1.5625
1.5625 / 2 = 0.78125
0.78125 / 2 = 0.390625
0.390625 / 2 = 0.19531
0.19531 / 2 = 0.09765
0.09765 / 2 = 0.0485
0.0485 / 2 = 0.0245
0.0245 / 2 = 0 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:
