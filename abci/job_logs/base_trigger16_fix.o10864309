Q: A trivia team had 12 members total, but during a game 4 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 8 points, how many points were scored total?
A: If we solve the problem stepwise, we can see that the total number of points scored is equal to the number of points scored by the 8 members who showed up, plus the number of points scored by the 4 members who didn't show up. The number of points scored by the 8 members who showed up is equal to the number of points scored by each of the 8 members, which is 8. The number of points scored by the 4 members who didn't show up is equal to the number of points scored by each of the 4 members, which is 8. Therefore, the total number of points scored is equal to 8 times 8, which is 64.
