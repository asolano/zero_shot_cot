A: Let's do it a little at a time.
First, we need to find the total number of lawns he mowed.
That's 14, right?
So the first step is to subtract 8 from 14, which gives us 6.

That gives us 1.
So the answer is 6 - 1 = 5.

Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 9 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's do it a little at a time.
First, we need to figure out how much each person owes.
There are 9 people.
2 of them are kids, so the other 7 people owe $2 each.
So the bill for the 7 people would be $14.
Now, we need to figure out how much the 2 kids owe.
Since the kids' meals are free, the kids don't owe anything.
So the bill for the 2 kids would be $0.
Now we add it all together.
The bill for the 7 people would be $14, and the bill for the 2 kids would be $0.
So 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $14.

A: Let's do it a little at a time.
First, we need to know how much money she made.
She sold all but 7 bars, so that means she sold 7 bars.
If each bar cost $4, then she made $28.
Now, we can figure out how much money she made.
She made $28, and there were 11 bars in the box.
That means that each bar cost $4.
If there were 11 bars in the box, then that means that there were 7 bars left.

Q: The cafeteria had 47 apples. For lunch they handed out 27 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 4 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's do it a little at a time.
First, we need to know how many students there are.
47 apples divided by 27 students = 1.7 apples per student.
Next, we need to know how many pies they can make.
4 apples per pie = 4 pies.
So, we have 1.7 apples per student and 4 pies per 47 apples.

Q: Wendy earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 11 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them, how many points would she have earned?
A: Let's do it a little at a time.

First, we need to know how many points she earned.

5 points for each bag of cans she recycled.
