Q: Edward bought 79 tickets at the state fair. He spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps. First, we need to find the total number of tickets Edward spent on rides. This is the number of tickets he bought minus the number of tickets he spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth. So, 79 - 23 = 56. Next, we need to find the number of rides he could go on. This is the number of tickets he spent on rides divided by the number of tickets each ride costs. So, 56 / 7 = 8.5. Finally, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. So, 8.5 rounded to the nearest whole number is 9. Therefore, Edward could go on

Q: Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps. First, we need to find out how many pounds Bianca recycled. We know that she recycled 24 pounds, so we can write that as 24 = 3(x). Next, we need to find out how many pounds her friends recycled. We know that they recycled 3 pounds, so we can write that as 3 = 3(y). Now, we can use the distributive property to solve for x and y. We can write 24 = 3(x) and 3 = 3(y), and then we can distribute the 3s to both sides. We get 24 = 3(3 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24.
