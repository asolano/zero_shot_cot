We can do this because we can make piles with 9 pieces of candy in each pile by taking piles with 8 pieces of candy in each pile and adding one piece of candy to each pile. We can do this because we can add one piece of candy to each pile in 9 different ways. We can do this becau

Q: Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 50 games from a friend and bought 27 more at a garage sale. If 74 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?
A: Let's do it step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Ned bought from his friend. We know that 50 games didn't work, so we can subtract 50 from the total number of games Ned bought. That leaves us with 74 - 50 = 24 games Ned bought from his friend.
Now, we need to find out how many games Ned bought at the garage sale. We know that 27 games didn't work, so we can subtract 27 from the total number of games Ned bought. That leaves us with 74 - 27 = 47 games Ned bought at the garage sale.

Q: The schools debate team had 28 boys and 4 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 4 how many groups could they make?
A: Let's do it step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to split 28 boys and 4 girls into groups of 4. We can do this by using the binomial coefficient. The binomial coefficient is a number that tells us how many ways we can split a group of n boys and m girls into groups of k boys and l girls. In this case, we have 28 boys and 4 girls, so n = 28 and m = 4. We want to split them into groups of 4, so k = 4 and l = 0. The binomial coefficient for this is 28 choose 4, which is 28!/(4! * (28 -

A: Let's do it step by step. First, we need to find the total number of games Mike has. So, 16 games minus 8 games equals 8 games. Now, we need to find the number of working games. So, 8 games minus 8 games equals 0 games. Now, we need to find the number of games Mike can sell. So, 0 games minus 7 games equals -7 games. Now, we need to find the number of games Mike can sell for $7 each. So, -7 games minus $7 games equals -$14 games. Now, we need to find the number of games Mike can sell for $7 each. So, -$14 games minus
