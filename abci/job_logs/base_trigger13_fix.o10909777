Q: Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
A: The answer is after the proof. The proof is a little long so I will just give you the idea. The idea is to use the fact that the number of games Edward sold is the same as the number of games he had left. So we can use the number of games he sold to find the number of games he had left. Then we can use the number of games he had left to find the number of boxes he had to us 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 19.

Q: Roger had 25 books. If he sold 21 of them and used the money he earned to buy 30 new books, how many books would Roger have?

Hint:
Let $x$ be the number of books Roger had before selling the 21 books. Let $y$ be the number of books Roger has after buying the 30 new books. Then, the number of books Roger has after selling the 21 books and buying the 30 new books is $21 + 30 = 51$. So, the number of books Roger has after selling the 21 books and buying the 30 new books is $51 - x$. Now, you can use the equation $y = x + 30$ to solve for $x$.

Hint:
The number of lives is the sum of the number of lives of the players who quit.
Proof:
Let the number of lives of the players who quit be $x$, $y$, and $z$.
The number of lives of the remaining players is $(8-3)-3 = 4$.
The total number of lives is $4 + x + y + z$.
The number of lives of the remaining players is $4$ because there are 4 players remaining.
The total number of lives is $4 + x + y + z$ because the number

Fact: If you have a number of coins, and you want to make change for a number of dollars, then the number of coins you need is the number of dollars you want to make change for, plus the number of pennies you have.
Proof: Let’s say you have a number of coins, and you want to make change for a number of dollars. Let’s say you have n coins, and you want to make change for d dollars. Let’s say you have m pennies. The

Q: Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?
A: The answer is after the proof. The proof is a bit long, so I will just give you the idea. The idea is to use the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have n pigeons and n holes, then at least one hole will have more than one pigeon in it. In this case, we have 9 holes and we have to put at least 9 pigeons in them. Since we have more than 9 pigeons, at least one hole will have more than one pigeon in it. So, we can conclude that at least one album will have more than 9 pictures in i

Q: At the arcade, Jerry won 29 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 17 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he spent 12 of his tickets on a hat, how many tickets does Jerry have left?
A: The answer is after the proof.The proof is a bit long, so I will give a hint:
Hint:
The number of tickets Jerry has left is the number of tickets he has minus the number of tickets he spent on the hat.
Proof:
Let the number of tickets Jerry has left be $x$.
Let the number of tickets Jerry has be $y$.
Let the number of tickets Jerry spent on the hat be $z$.
Then, we have the following equation:
$$x+y+z=29+17$$
$$x+y+z=46$$
$$x+y+z=46$$
$$x+y+z=46$$
$$x+y

Q: Wendy picked 45 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. If 35 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: The answer is after the proof. The proof is a little bit long, so I will just give you the idea. First, we need to find the number of ways to make bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. This is the same as the number of ways to choose 5 flowers from 45. This is 45C5. Then, we need to find the number of ways to choose 35 flowers from 45. This is 45C35. Then, we need to find the number of ways to choose 5 flowers from 35. This is 35C5. Then, we need to find the number of ways to choose 5 flowers from 5. This is 5C5. The

Q: There were 17 girls and 32 boys trying out for the schools basketball team. If only 10 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?
A: The answer is after the proof. The first step is to find the number of students who made the cut. This is the number of students who were called back, which is 10. The second step is to find the number of students who didn't make the cut. This is the number of students who tried out, which is 17 + 32 = 49. The third step is to subtract the number of students who made the cut from the number of students who tried out. This is 49 - 10 = 39. The fourth step is to divide the number of students who didn't make the cut by the number of students who tried out. This is 39/49 = 0

Q: Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have?
A: The answer is after the proof. The proof is in the spoiler below.

 The answer is 3. The reason is that the number of seeds planted in the big garden is 12. The number of seeds planted in each of the small gardens is 3. So, the total number of seeds planted is 12 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 +

Q: Frank had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 37 dollars for his allowance, how many 8 dollar toys could he buy?
A: The answer is after the proof. The proof is a bit long, so I will just give you the idea. The idea is to use the fact that the number of ways to buy 8 toys is the same as the number of ways to buy 8 toys and 1 toy. Then we can use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to buy 8 toys and 1 toy. Then we can subtract the number of ways to buy 8 toys from the number of ways to buy 8 toys and 1 toy to find the number of ways to buy 8 toys and 1 toy. Then we can multiply the number of ways to buy 8 toys and 1 toy by 37 to fi 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
