A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. Bianca picked 23 carrots from her garden. If she threw out 10 of them and then picked 47 more the next day, how many carrots would she have total?
The first step is to find the difference between the two numbers. In this case, the difference is 23 - 10 = 13. The next step is to multiply the difference by the number of carrots picked the second day. In this case, 47 x 13 = 613. The last step is to add the number of carrots picked the first day. In this case, 23 + 613 = 62

Q: A store had 5 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 2 of the old ones and put 28 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. First, we need to know how many oranges were in the bin before the change. We know that there were 5 oranges in the bin before the change. So, we can write the equation 5 = 2 + 28. Now, we need to solve for the number of oranges in the bin after the change. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. We get 5 = 28 - 2. We can then divide both sides of the equation by 5. We get 28 / 5 = 5 / 2. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by 2. We get 28 x 2 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 56 oranges in the bin after the change.
