Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days it will take for Megan to eat all the candy. We can do this by dividing the number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces Megan eats each day. So, 11 divided by 8 is 1.375. This means that Megan will eat all the candy in 1.375 days. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Megan to eat 8 pieces of candy each day. We can do this by dividing the number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces Megan eats each day. So, 11 divided by 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.375 days.

Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to know how many carrots they had in total. So, we add the 26 and 15 together. That gives us 41. Then, we need to know how many good carrots they had. So, we subtract the 16 from the 41. That gives us 25. Finally, we need to know how many bad carrots they had. So, we subtract the 25 from the 41. That gives us 16.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16 (bad carrots).

Q: John had 33 socks. If he threw away 19 old ones that didn't fit and bought 13 new ones, how many socks would he have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to know how many socks John had before throwing away the old ones. So, we need to subtract 19 from 33. 33 - 19 = 14. So, John had 14 socks before throwing away the old ones.
Now, we need to know how many socks John has after buying the new ones. So, we need to add 13 to 14. 14 + 13 = 27. So, John has 27 socks after buying the new ones.

Q: In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 3 of them, how many points would you earn?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to know how many enemies there are. 11 is the total number of enemies, so we need to subtract the number of enemies you didn't destroy. 11 - 3 = 8. Now we need to know how many points each enemy gives you. 9 is the number of points each enemy gives you, so we need to multiply the number of enemies you didn't destroy by the number of points each enemy gives you. 8 x 9 = 72. Finally, we need to add the number of points you earned. 72 + 9 = 81. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

Q: The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to know how many apples are left. So, we need to subtract the number of apples given out from the total number of apples. 75 - 19 = 56. Now, we need to know how many apples are needed to make one pie. So, we need to divide the number of apples left by the number of apples needed to make one pie. 56 ÷ 8 = 7.5. Now, we need to know how many pies can be made. So, we need to multiply the number of apples left by the number of apples needed to make one pie. 56 × 7.5 = 435. S

Q: Henry had 3 action figures, but needed 8 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the number of action figures Henry needs to buy. We know that he needs 8 action figures, so we can write that as 8 = n. Then, we need to find the number of action figures he already has. We know that he has 3 action figures, so we can write that as 3 = m. Now, we can use the equation n = m + 8 to solve for m. We can then substitute the value of m into the equation n = m + 8 to solve for n. We can then substitute the value of n into the equation n = m + 8 to solve for  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $18.$
Now, let's try to solve this problem using the equation n = m + 8. We know that Henry has 3 action figures,

Vanessa had 13 music files and 30 video files. So, Vanessa had 43 files before she deleted any. Now, we need to know how many files Vanessa has after she deleted 10 of them. So, we need to subtract the number of files she deleted from the number of files she had before she deleted any. Vanessa deleted 10 files. So, Vanessa has 33 files after she deleted 10 of them.
