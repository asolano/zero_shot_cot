Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Megan received. This is the sum of the number of pieces of candy she received from her neighbors and the number of pieces of candy she received from her older sister. So, we have 11 + 5 = 16 pieces of candy.
Now, we need to find the number of days it will take Megan to eat 8 pieces of candy a day. This is the number of days it will take her to eat all of the candy she received. So, we have 16 ÷ 8 = 2.5 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.5 day

Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: First, we need to find out how many carrots they had in total. We can do this by adding the number of carrots Bianca picked and the number of carrots her mother picked. 26 + 15 = 41.
Now we need to find out how many good carrots they had. We can do this by subtracting the number of bad carrots from the total number of carrots. 41 – 16 = 25.
Now we need to find out how many bad carrots they had. We can do this by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots. 41 – 25 = 16.

Q: Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: First, we need to find the total number of books Bianca had. We know that there are 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books. We also know that each shelf has 8 books. So, we can use the equation 5x + 4x = 8x. We can solve this equation by adding the two sides together: 5x + 4x = 8x + 8x. We can then divide both sides by 8 to get 5x + 4x = 16. We can then solve for x by subtracting 5x from both sides: x = 16 – 5x. We can then solve for x by subtracti 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16 – 5x = 16 – 5(8) = 16 – 40 = 6. Therefore, Bianca had 6 books total.

A: First, we need to find out how many flowers Wendy had. We know that she picked 103 flowers, so 103 is the total number of flowers. We also know that she was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. So, 103 divided by 8 is 12.5. Wendy had 12.5 bouquets. 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, so Wendy had 12.5 bouquets minus 47 bouquets. That is equal to 7.5 bouquets. Wendy could still make 7.5 bouquets.

Q: A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: First, we need to know how many siamese cats they had. We know that there are 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. We also know that 19 cats were sold. We can use the equation 15 + 49 = 64. We know that 19 cats were sold, so we can subtract 19 from 64. 64 – 19 = 45. We know that 19 cats were sold, so we can subtract 19 from 64. 64 – 19 = 45. We know that 19 cats were sold, so we can subtract 19 from 64. 64 – 19 = 45. We know that 19 cats were sold, so we can subtract 19 fr

Q: Roger had 25 books. If he sold 21 of them and used the money he earned to buy 30 new books, how many books would Roger have?
A: First, we need to find the number of books Roger had before he sold 21 of them. We know that Roger had 25 books before he sold 21 of them. So, we can write 25 = 21 + x, where x is the number of books Roger had before he sold 21 of them. We can solve for x by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation. We get x = 25 – 21 = 4. So, Roger had 4 books before he sold 21 of them.
Now, we need to find the number of books Roger has after he buys 30 new books. We know that Roger has 4 books before he sells 21  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 + 30 = 34.

Q: A store had 5 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 2 of the old ones and put 28 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: First, we need to know how many oranges were in the bin before the change. We know that the store had 5 oranges in the bin before the change. We also know that they threw away 2 of the old oranges and put 28 new ones in the bin. We can use the equation 5 + 2 = 28 to solve for the number of oranges in the bin before the change. We get 5 + 2 = 28, so 5 = 28 – 2. We can solve for 5 by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. We get 5 = 28 – 2, so 5 = 26. We know that the sto

Q: A painter needed to paint 9 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: First, we need to find the total number of hours needed to paint all 9 rooms. This is the sum of the hours needed to paint each room. So, 9 x 8 = 72 hours.
Now, we need to find the number of hours that have already been used. This is the number of hours that have been used to paint the 5 rooms. So, 5 x 8 = 40 hours.
The number of hours that are left to paint the remaining 4 rooms is 72 - 40 = 32 hours. So, the painter will take 32 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32 hours.

So, we need to find the number of pieces of clothing in 2.5 loads. 2.5 loads is 2.5 × 48 = 120 pieces of clothing. 120 ÷ 120 = 1 piece of clothing. So, 1 piece of clothing can go in each of the small loads.

So, the total number of meals is 12, and the number of adult meals is 5. We can now use the formula for the total cost of a group of people:
The total cost of the group is $45. This is because each adult meal costs $3, and there are 5 adult meals. The total cost of the group is the total number of meals multiplied by the cost of each meal.

Q: A store had 50 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 40 of the old ones and put 24 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
A: First, we need to know how many oranges were in the bin before the store threw away 40 of them. We know that the store had 50 oranges in the bin before they threw away 40 of them. So, we can write the equation 50 = 40 + 24. We can solve this equation by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation. We get 50 – 40 = 24. We can then write the equation 24 = 24 + 0. We can solve this equation by adding 0 to both sides of the equation. We get 24 + 0 = 24. We can then write the equation 24 = 24. We can solve this equati 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24 orange

Q: At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 4 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $9 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?
A: First, we need to find out how much money each customer tipped. We know that the waiter got $9 from each of the 4 customers who tipped. So, we can write the equation $9 + 4(x) = $ total tip money. We can solve this equation for x. We get x = $3. So, each customer tipped $3. Now, we need to find out how much money the waiter got from the 3 customers who didn't tip. We know that the waiter got $9 from each of the 4 customers who tipped. So, we can write the equation $9 + 3 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $9 + 3 + 4(3) = $ total money earne

Q: A pet store has 6 bird cages. If each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?
A: First, we need to find the total number of birds in the pet store. We know that there are 6 bird cages, and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets. So, we can write the equation 6c + 2(6p) = 6c + 12p. We can solve this equation by adding the two sides of the equation. 6c + 12p = 6c + 2(6p) + 6c + 12p. 6c + 12p = 6c + 6c + 12p. 6c + 12p = 18c + 12p. 6c + 12p =
