Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we will get the answer. First, we will find the number of days it will take to eat 8 pieces of candy. Then, we will find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining pieces of candy.
The number of days it will take to eat 8 pieces of candy is 8 ÷ 8 = 1 day. The number of days it will take to eat the remaining pieces of candy is 11 ÷ 8 = 1.375 days.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.375 day

Q: Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we will get the answer. First, we will find the number of pounds recycled by Paige. For every 4 pounds recycled, they earned one point. So, 14/4 = 3.5. So, Paige recycled 3.5 pounds. Now, we will find the number of pounds recycled by her friends. For every 4 pounds recycled, they earned one point. So, 2/4 = 0.5. So, her friends recycled 0.5 pounds. So, the total number of pounds recycled is 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 pound

We will do this by subtracting the number of students who do not want fruit from the total number of students. So, the number of students who want fruit is 6 + 15 – 5 = 20. Now, we will find the number of apples that the cafeteria ordered. We will do this by adding the number of red apples and the number of green apples. So, the number of apples that the cafeteria ordered is 6 + 15 = 21. Now, we will find the number of extra apples that the cafeteria ended up wi

A: If we solve the problem gradually, we can see that the number of chocolate chip cookies is 23 and the number of oatmeal cookies is 25. We know that each bag has 6 cookies. So, we can make 23 x 6 = 138 chocolate chip cookies and 25 x 6 = 150 oatmeal cookies. We can make 138 + 150 = 288 cookies in total. We can make 288 / 6 = 48 baggies of cookies. So, Robin can make 48 baggies of cookies.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 48.
 
If we solve the problem using the distributive property, we can see that the number of chocolate chip cookies is 23 x 6 = 138 and t

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 51 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we will get the answer. First, we will find the number of students who wanted fruit. We will do this by subtracting the number of students who did not want fruit from the total number of students. So, we will subtract 51 from 100. This gives us 49 students who wanted fruit. Next, we will find the number of apples that the cafeteria ordered. We will do this by subtracting the number of apples that the cafeteria did not order from the total number of apples. So, we will subtract 37 from 100. This gives us 63 apples that the cafeteria ordered. Finally, we will find the number  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 63 - 37 = 26.

Q: Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we can see that Oliver needs to put away 4 books on each of the first 10 shelves, then 3 books on each of the next 10 shelves, then 2 books on each of the next 10 shelves, and finally 1 book on each of the last 10 shelves. So he needs 10 shelves for the first 10 books, 10 shelves for the next 10 books, 10 shelves for the next 10 books, and 10 shelves for the last 10 books. So he needs 40 shelves in total.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 40.

A: If we solve the problem gradually, we can see that the first step is to find the number of brownies she baked. So, we need to find the number of cups of flour she used. We know that she used 6 cups of flour per brownie, so we can multiply 6 by 7 to find the total number of cups of flour she used. We can then subtract the number of cups of flour she used from the total number of cups of flour she needed to find the number of cups of flour she still needs. So, 6 times 7 is 42, and 16 minus 42 is 16. So, she still needs 16 cups of flour.

Q: Edward was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 41 games from a friend and bought 14 more at a garage sale. If 31 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we can see that Edward bought 41 games from a friend and 14 more at a garage sale. If 31 of the games didn't work, then he bought 41 - 31 = 10 games from his friend and 14 - 31 = 3 games at the garage sale. So, he bought 10 + 3 = 13 games in total. Since he bought 41 games in total, he bought 13 / 41 = 0.3 games in total. So, he bought 0.3 good games in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.

Q: A book store had 4 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we will get the answer. First, we will find the number of books in the bin after selling 3 books. Then, we will find the number of books in the bin after putting 10 more books in it. Finally, we will find the number of books in the bin after selling 3 books and putting 10 more books in it.
The number of books in the bin after selling 3 books = 3 (books in the bin before selling 3 books) – 3 (books sold) = 3 – 3 = 0
The number of books in the bin after putting 10 more books in it = 10 (books in the bin before putting 10 mo

Q: The school cafeteria had 14 apples. If they used 13 to make lunch for the students and then bought 49 more, how many apples would they have?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we will get the answer. First, we will find the number of apples they had before buying the 49 more. We will do this by subtracting the number of apples they used to make lunch from the total number of apples. So, 14 – 13 = 1. So, they had 1 apple before buying the 49 more. Now, we will find the number of apples they have after buying the 49 more. We will do this by adding the number of apples they bought to the number of apples they had before buying the 49 more. So, 49 + 1 = 50. So, they have 50 apples after buying the 49 more 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50.

We know that there are 14 adults and 9 people per van. So, we can divide 14 by 9 to get the number of adults per van. We get 1.4. So, we need 1.4 vans. We can round up to 2 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 vans.

Q: A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: If we solve the problem gradually, we will get the answer. First, we will find the time taken to cook 8 potatoes. Then, we will find the time taken to cook the remaining 7 potatoes. Finally, we will add the two times to get the total time.
The time taken to cook 8 potatoes is 8 × 9 = 72 minutes. The time taken to cook 7 potatoes is 7 × 9 = 63 minutes. The total time taken to cook 15 potatoes is 72 + 63 = 139 minutes.
