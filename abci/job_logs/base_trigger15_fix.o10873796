A: Let's solve the problem bit by bit. First, we need to find out how many socks George had before he threw away 4 old ones and bought 36 new ones. We can do this by subtracting the number of socks he threw away from the number of socks he had before he threw them away. So, 28 - 4 = 24. Now, we need to find out how many socks George has now. We can do this by adding the number of socks he bought to the number of socks he had before he bought them. So, 36 + 24 = 60. Finally, we need to find out how many socks George has now.  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Q: Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: Let's solve the problem bit by bit. First, we need to find out how many bouquets Isabel could make with 8 flowers in each one. We know that she picked 66 flowers, so she could make 66/8 = 8 bouquets. Now, we need to find out how many flowers wilted. We know that 10 flowers wilted, so we can write the equation 10 = 66 - 8. We can solve this equation by subtracting 8 from both sides, which gives us 10 = 58. We can then divide both sides by 8, which gives us 10/8 = 1.25. We can round this up to 2, so Isabel could make 2 bouquets

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's solve the problem bit by bit. First, we need to find out how many points Emily scored. We know that she scored 23 points, so we can write that as 23 = x + 2(n - 1), where x is the number of points Emily scored and n is the number of players on her team. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2(n - 1): 23/2(n - 1) = x. We can then solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2(n - 1): 23x = 23(2(n - 1)). We can then solve for x by dividing bo
