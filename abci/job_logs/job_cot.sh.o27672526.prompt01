Q: A trivia team had 14 members total, but during a game 7 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 5 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the number of points scored by each member that showed up.
We know that each member that showed up scored 5 points.
So, we can write this as:

5(n-1) + 5(n) = 5(n-1) + 5(n)

Now, we need to find the number of points scored by the members that didn't show up.
We know that each member that didn't show up scored 0 points.
So, we can write this as:

0(n-1) + 0(n) = 0( 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

14(n-1) + 14(n) = 14(n-1) + 14(n)

Q: While on vacation, Nancy took 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she later deleted 38 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have?
A: Let's think step by step.

First, we need to find the number of pictures she took at the zoo.

49 - 38 = 11

Next, we need to find the number of pictures she took at the museum.

8 - 38 = 30

Now we can add the two numbers together.

11 + 30 = 41

Finally, we can subtract the number of pictures she took at the zoo from the number of pictures she took at the museum.

41 - 11 = 30

30 is the number of pictures she took at the museum.

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

Q: Emily was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 16 points and in the second round she scored 33 points. In the last round she lost 48 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the number of points she had at the end of the first round.
16 + 16 = 32
Then, we need to find the number of points she had at the end of the second round.
33 + 33 = 66
