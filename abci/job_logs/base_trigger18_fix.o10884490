Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: If we solve the problem piecemeal, we can see that the number of days is equal to the number of pieces of candy divided by the number of pieces of candy she ate each day. So, 11 divided by 8 is 1.375, which is rounded up to 2 days. The same logic applies to the 5 pieces of candy from her older sister. 5 divided by 8 is 0.625, which is rounded up to 1 day. So, the candy will last her 2 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

Q: In fourth grade there were 4 students at the start of the year. During the year 3 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: If we solve the problem piecemeal, we can see that the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is equal to the number of students in fourth grade at the start of the year plus the number of new students minus the number of students who left. So, we can write the equation as follows:
The number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is equal to the number of students in fourth grade at the start of the year plus the number of new students minus the number of students who left.
The number of students in fourth grade at the start of the year is 4. The number of new students is 42. The number of studen

So, he will need to make at least 12 trips to pick up all the trays. However, he can pick up the 23 trays from one table in 7 trips and the 5 trays from the other table in 5 trips.

A: If we solve the problem piecemeal, we can see that the number of apples in the cafeteria is 12 + 8 + 19 = 37. But we can also see that the number of apples in the cafeteria is the same as the number of apples bought, so we can write the problem as 37 = 8 + 19. We can solve this equation by subtracting 8 from both sides, which gives us 37 – 8 = 19. We can then divide both sides by 8, which gives us 19 ÷ 8 = 2.25. The answer is 2.25 apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $27$.

Q: Bianca was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 52 seeds and planted 40 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each. How many small gardens did Bianca have?
A: If we solve the problem piecemeal, we can see that Bianca had 40 big gardens and 20 small gardens. But we can also see that she planted 40 seeds in the big garden and 20 seeds in each of the small gardens. So, she planted 80 seeds in all. Since she started with 52 seeds, she must have lost 12 seeds. She lost 12 seeds in the big garden and 2 seeds in each of the small gardens. So, she lost 12 + 2 x 20 = 32 seeds. Since she planted 80 seeds, she must have had 40 + 20 = 60 plants. So, she had 40 big gardens and 20 small gardens.

Q: Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: If we solve the problem piecemeal, we can see that Dave will need to make at least two trips to pick up the 17 trays from one table and at least two trips to pick up the 55 trays from the other table. So, he will need to make at least four trips in total. However, if we solve the problem as a whole, we can see that Dave will need to make exactly four trips. This is because he can pick up the 17 trays from one table in two trips, and then pick up the 55 trays from the other table in two trips. So, he will need to make exactly four trips in total.

A: If we solve the problem piecemeal, we can see that there are 49 pictures at the zoo and 8 at the museum. If she deleted 38 pictures, then there are 9 pictures at the zoo and 2 at the museum. Since there are 49 pictures at the zoo, we know that there are 9 pictures at the zoo and 40 at the museum. Since there are 8 pictures at the museum, we know that there are 2 pictures at the museum and 36 at the zoo. Since there are 49 pictures at the zoo, we know that there are 40 pictures at the museum.
