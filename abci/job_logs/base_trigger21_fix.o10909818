Q: Adam had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have?
A: Let's make sure we get the right answer. Let's start with the number of books Adam had before he sold any of them. He had 48 books. Let's call that number x. Then, let's call the number of books he had after he sold 19 of them y. So, we know that y = x - 19. Now, let's call the number of books he has after he buys 38 new books z. So, z = y + 38. We know that z = x - 19 + 38. Now, we can solve for x. We know that x = z - 38. So, x = 48 - 38 = 10. So, Adam had 10 books before
