Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think about this problem. Bianca and her mom picked 26 and 15 carrots, respectively. If only 16 of the carrots were good, that means that there were 10 bad carrots. So, we can write the equation as follows:
Now, we can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 10. We get the following equation: 26 × 10 = 160. We can then divide both sides by 10 to get the answer of 16.

Q: There school's baseball team had 31 new players and 4 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 7 players in each group, how many groups would there be?
A: Let's think about this problem a little bit differently. We know that there are 31 new players and 4 returning players. We also know that there are 7 players in each group. So, we can use the equation 31 + 4 = 7(x) to solve for x. We know that x is equal to the number of groups. So, we can plug in the numbers and solve for x. We get x = 7. Therefore, there are 7 groups.

Q: For Halloween Haley scored 33 pieces of candy. She ate 17 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 19 more pieces. How many pieces of candy does Haley have now?
A: Let's think about this problem. First, we need to know how many pieces of candy Haley had the first night. We know that she ate 17 pieces. So, we can write that as 17 = x. Now, we need to know how many pieces of candy Haley has now. We know that her sister gave her 19 more pieces. So, we can write that as 19 = y. Now, we can solve this problem by subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation. We get x - 17 = y. We can then divide both sides of the equation by 17. We get x = y + 14.  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is y + 1

Q: A chef needs to cook 16 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's think about this problem in terms of the number of potatoes that are left to cook. The number of potatoes that are left to cook is equal to the number of potatoes that are already cooked plus the number of potatoes that are still to be cooked. So, we can write this as 7 + 16 - 7 = 16. Now, we know that each potato takes 5 minutes to cook. So, we can write this as 16 x 5 = 80. So, it will take the chef 80 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 80 minute

We also know that each room takes 8 hours to paint, so we can write this as 8 hours per room. We can combine these two equations to get 5/9 = 8 hours per room. We can then divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get 5/9 = 1 hour per room. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by 9 to get 5 hours.

Q: A painter needed to paint 6 rooms in a building. Each room takes 5 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's think about this problem in terms of the number of rooms that have been painted. We know that the painter has painted 2 rooms, so we can write this as 2/6. We also know that each room takes 5 hours to paint, so we can write this as 5 hours. We can combine these two equations to get 2/6 = 5 hours. We can then divide both sides by 2 to get 5/6 = 5 hours. We can then multiply both sides by 6 to get 30 hours. We can then divide both sides by 5 to get 6 hours. We can then multiply both sides by 2 to get 12 hours. We can then divi

The first part is easy. Each player had 7 lives before the new players joined. So, the first part of the problem is 7 x 7 = 49.
The second part is a little trickier. We need to figure out how many lives each player has after the new players joined. We know that each player had 7 lives before the new players joined. So, each player has 7 lives after the new playe 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 49 + 7 x 7 = 49 + 49 = 98.

So, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation. We get -48 = -16. Now, we can divide both sides by -48. We get 1 = -16/48. We can simplify this. We get 1 = -1/24. We can multiply both sides by 24. We get 24 = -1/24. We can divide both sides by -1/24. We get 24 = 1. We can multiply both sides by 2

Q: At a company picnic 23 managers and 7 employees decided to start a game of volleyball. If they split into 6 teams how many people would be on each team?
A: Let's think about this problem in two parts. First, we need to figure out how many teams there are. We know that there are 23 managers and 7 employees. We also know that there are 6 teams. We can use the equation 23 + 7 = 6 to solve for the number of teams. We get 6 = 23 + 7. We can then solve for the number of teams by subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation. We get 6 - 23 = 7. We can then solve for the number of teams by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation. We get 6 - 7 = 1. We can then solve for t 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

A: Let's think about this problem in terms of the number of students who made the cut. We know that 10 students made the cut, so that means that 17 students didn't make the cut. We can use the word "or" to represent the fact that either a girl or a boy made the cut. So, we can write the problem as follows:
The number of students who didn't make the cut is equal to the number of girls who didn't make the cut plus the number of boys who didn't make the cut.
The number of girls who didn't make the cut is equal to the number of girls who tried out minus the number of girls who made the cut

A: Let's think about this problem in terms of the number of rooms that have been painted. We know that the painter has painted 2 rooms, so we can write this as 2/11. We also know that each room takes 7 hours to paint, so we can write this as 7 hours. Now, we can use the division property of multiplication to multiply 2/11 by 7 hours. This gives us 14 hours. We can then divide 14 hours by 7 hours to get 2. We can then write this as 2 days. This means that the painter will take 2 days to paint the remaining 9 rooms. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 days.

We know that there are 44 returning players, so we can write that as 44 = 8x + y, where x is the number of returning players in each group and y is the number of returning players not in any group. We can then solve for x and y. We know that x + y = 44, so we can write that as 8x + y = 44. We can then subtract 8x from both sides to get y = 44 - 8x. We can then divide both sides by 8 to get y =
