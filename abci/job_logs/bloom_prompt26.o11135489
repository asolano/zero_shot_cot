Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's do it a little at a time. First, let's figure out how many days it would take to eat 8 pieces of candy. We can do that by dividing 8 by the number of pieces of candy she gets each day. 8 divided by 11 is 0.73, so it would take her about 0.73 days to eat 8 pieces of candy. Now, let's figure out how many days it would take to eat 5 pieces of candy. We can do that by dividing 5 by the number of pieces of candy she gets each day. 5 divided by 11 is 0.45, so it would take her about 0.45 days to eat 5 pieces 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.73 + 0.45 = 1.18 days.
