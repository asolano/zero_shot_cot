Q: At the arcade Dave won 25 tickets. If he spent 22 tickets on a beanie and later won 15 more tickets, how many would he have?
A: Let's do it step by step.

First, we need to find the number of tickets he has.

25 - 22 = 3

Next, we need to find the number of tickets he has left.

3 - 22 = -19

Now, we need to find the number of tickets he has left after spending 22 tickets on a beanie.

-19 - 22 = -7

Finally, we need to find the number of tickets he has left after winning 15 more tickets.

-7 + 15 = 8

So, Dave has 8 tickets left.

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

8

Q: Edward bought 79 tickets at the state fair. He spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
A: Let's do it step by step.

First, we need to find the number of rides he can go on.

We know that he spent 23 tickets at the dunk a clown booth.

We know that each ride costs 7 tickets.

We know that he has 79 tickets left.

So, we can write this as:

(23 + 7) - 79 = 0

We can solve this equation for the number of rides he can go on.

We know that 23 + 7 = 30.

We know that 79 - 30 = 49.

We know that 30 - 7 = 23.

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

(23 + 7) - 79 = 0

(23 + 7) - 79 = 0

(23 + 7) - 79

Q: Oliver had 35 dollars. For his birthday he got 50 more dollars but spent 84 on a new game. How much money does he have now?

85 - 84 = 1
1 + 35 = 36
36 - 35 = 1
36 - 1 = 35
35 - 35 = 0
0 + 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35

Q: John made 6 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's do it step by step.

First, we need to find the rate of change of money.

Rate of change of money = (money in the first week) - (money in the second week)

Rate of change of money = 6 - 18 = -12

Next, we need to find the rate of change of time.

Rate of change of time = (time in the first week) - (time in the second week)

Rate of change of time = 6 - 18 = -12

Now, we can solve for the rate of change of money over time.

Rate of change of money

Q: Oliver had 35 dollars. For his birthday he got 50 more dollars but spent 84 on a new game. How much money does he have now?
A: Let's do it step by step.
35 + 50 = 85
85 - 84 = 1
1 + 35 = 36
36 - 35 = 1
36 - 1 = 35
35 - 35 = 0
0 + 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70
70 - 35 = 35
35 + 35 = 70

Q: A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have?
A: Let's do it step by step.
First, we need to find the number of tables.
We know that there are 4 people at each table.
So, we need to multiply 4 by the number of tables.
We know that there are 22 people in the section.
So, we need to multiply 22 by the number of tables.
We know that 14 people left.
So, we need to subtract 14 from 22.
We know that the rest of the tables had 4 people at each table.

Q: A trivia team had 7 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 4 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's do it step by step.
First, we need to find the number of points scored by each member.
We know that each member that showed up scored 4 points.
So, we can write this as:

4(1) + 4(2) + 4(3) + 4(4) + 4(5) + 4(6) + 4(7) = 56

Next, we need to find the total number of points scored by the team.
We know that there were 7 members total, so we can write this as:

56/7 = 8

So, the total number of points scored 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's do it step by step.

First, we need to find the number of pictures in each album.

65 pictures were uploaded to Facebook.

17 pics were put into one album.

The rest were put into 6 different albums.

So, the number of pictures in each album is:

6! / (65 + 17)

6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:

6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6! / (65 + 17) = 6!

Q: Robin's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 8 people and there are 22 students and 2 adults going, how many vans will they need?
A: Let's do it step by step.
First, we need to know how many people are in each van.
We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of adults.
22 students x 2 adults = 44 people
Next, we need to know how many vans they need.
We can do this by dividing the number of people by the number of vans.
44 people / 8 vans = 5. 5 people per van
