Q: A trivia team had 12 members total, but during a game 4 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 8 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that the total number of points scored is equal to the number of members that showed up times 8. So, we can write that as 12 x 8. Now, we know that 4 members didn't show up, so we can subtract that from the total number of members. So, 12 - 4 = 8. Now, we can divide both sides by 8 to get the total number of points scored. 12 / 8 = 1.5. So, the total number of points scored is 1.5 x 8 = 12 points.

Q: There school's baseball team had 31 new players and 4 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 7 players in each group, how many groups would there be?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that there are 31 new players and 4 returning players. We also know that there are 7 players in each group. So, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the total number of groups. The formula is (a + r) * (1 - q)^(n - 1) = 0. We know that a = 31, r = 4, and q = 7/31. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for n. We get n = (31 + 4) * (1 - 7/31)^(31 - 1) = (31 +

Q: In fourth grade there were 11 students at the start of the year. During the year 6 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's be smart about this.

The number of players is 5, so we can write that as 5x. The number of lives each player had before the new players joined is 8, so we can write that as 8y. We can solve this equation for y, and then we can substitute that value for y into the equation to solve for x.
The number of lives each player had before the new players joined is 8, so we can write that as 8y

A: Let's be smart about this. We know that there are 2 students and 6 adults. We also know that each van can hold 4 people. So, we can write this as 2 + 6 = 4(2) = 8. We know that there are 8 people in total. We also know that there are 2 students and 6 adults. So, we can write this as 8 = 2 + 6. We can solve this equation to get 2 = 6. We know that this is not possible. So, we know that there are not enough vans to take everyone on the field trip.
 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is (6).

Q: A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 6. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that 15 potatoes take 15 x 8 minutes to cook. So, we can just multiply 6 x 8 to get the time it takes to cook 6 potatoes. Then, we can subtract that from 15 x 8 to get the time it takes to cook the remaining 9 potatoes. So, 6 x 8 = 48 minutes. 15 x 8 = 120 minutes. 48 - 120 = -72 minutes. 72 minutes is the time it takes to cook the remaining 9 potatoes.

Q: Rachel was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that the score is 9 points for each treasure. So, we can write that as 9x. We also know that she found 5 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second. So, we can write that as 5x + 2x. Now, we just need to solve for x. We can do that by adding the two equations together. We get 9x + 5x + 2x = 9x + 7x. Now, we can divide both sides by 9. We get x + x = 2x. We can subtract x from both sides. We get x = x. So, the answer is

Q: Jerry had 7 action figures, but needed 16 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $8, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know Jerry needs 16 action figures, so we can write that as a sum: 16 = 7 + 9. Now we can use the distributive property to break this down into two parts: 16 = 7 + (9 - 7). We know that 9 - 7 = 2, so we can rewrite the equation as 16 = 7 + 2. Now we can use the distributive property again to break this down into two parts: 16 = 7 + (2 + 7). We know that 2 + 7 = 9, so we can rewrite the equation as 16 = 7 + 9. Now we can use the distributive property again  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $16 = 7 + 9 = 16$ (decimal numbers).

A: Let's be smart about this. We know that the painter has already painted 2 rooms, so he has 4 rooms left to paint. We also know that each room takes 5 hours to paint. So, we can calculate the total time it will take to paint the 4 rooms by multiplying 4 by 5. This gives us 20 hours. We can then subtract 20 from the total time it will take to paint the 6 rooms. This gives us 40 hours. We can then divide 40 by 5 to get 8. This means that the painter will take 8 hours longer to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

So, we can use the distributive property to break this down into two parts. First, we can break down the chocolate candy. We know that 6 boxes of chocolate candy is the same as 6 times 9 pieces of chocolate candy. Then, we can break down the caramel candy. We know that 4 boxes of caramel candy is the same as 4 times 9 pieces of caramel candy. Now, we can add these two together to g 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 54 pieces of candy.

Q: A teacher had 6 worksheets to grade. If she graded 4, but then another 18 were turned in, how many worksheets would she have to grade?
A: Let's be smart about this. The teacher has 6 worksheets to grade. She grades 4. Then another 18 are turned in. So, she has 6 + 4 + 18 = 26 worksheets to grade. She grades 4 of them. So, she has 26 - 4 = 22 worksheets to grade. She grades 4 of them. So, she has 22 - 4 = 18 worksheets to grade. She grades 4 of them. So, she has 18 - 4 = 14 worksheets to grade. She grades 4 of them. So, she has 14 - 4 = 10 worksheets to grade. She grades 4 of them. So, she has 10

Q: Tiffany was playing a video game where she scores 6 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 3 treasures on the first level and 5 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that the score is the sum of the points for each treasure. So, we can break this down into two parts:
The first part is the score for the first level. We know that she found 3 treasures on the first level, so her score for the first level is 3 points.
The second part is the score for the second level. We know that she found 5 treasures on the second level, so her score for the second level is 5 points.
Now, we just need to add the two parts together to get the total score. The total score is 3 + 5 = 8 points. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.
If you want to use Roman numerals, you can write the answer as VII

We can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 6. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x = 36x. 6x

A: Let's be smart about this. We know that 47 apples were given out for lunch. We also know that each pie takes 4 apples. So, we can use the equation 47 = 27 + 4(x) to solve for x. We know that x is the number of pies that can be made. So, we can plug in 27 for the 27 apples given out for lunch and 4 for the number of apples in each pie. We get 47 = 27 + 4(x). We can then solve for x by dividing both sides by 4. We get x = 47 / 4 = 11. So, they could make 11 pies.

Q: Haley had 27 music files and 42 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 11 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that the total number of files is the sum of the music files and the video files. So, we can write that as 27 + 42 = 69. We also know that the total number of files is the number of files that are still on the flash drive plus the number of files that were deleted. So, we can write that as 69 + 11 = 80. We can solve this equation for the number of files that were deleted. We get 11 = 80 - 69. We can subtract 69 from both sides of the equation. We get 11 = 11. We can divide both sides of the equation by 11. We g

We can also write that as 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

Q: The cafeteria had 86 apples. For lunch they handed out 30 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's be smart about this. We know that 86 apples were given out for lunch. We also know that each pie takes 8 apples. So, we can use the equation 8x = 86.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 704.
